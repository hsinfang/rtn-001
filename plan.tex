\section{Planning and team(s) fro DP0} \label{sec:plan}


\subsection {Teams}

The main departments involved in this are Data Production and System Performance. With in those departments various people will be involved from the underlying teams but in small numbers. It makes most sense to approach DP0 with a task force approach. This might best be seen as two teams:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data production - with a focus on middleware and execution (\secref{sec:dp});
\item System Performance - with a focus on quality assurance and community support (\secref{sec:sp}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DP Middleware and Execution}\label{sec:dp}
For DP0 on IDF Hsin-Fang Chiang would coordinate Data Production activities and be the point
of contact for the IDF provider.

\subsection{SP Quality  and Community Support} \label{sec:sp}
